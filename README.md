# Climate Documents Analysis using NLP - Tokenization

🌍 Welcome to the Climate Documents Analysis repository! 🌍

This project focuses on extracting valuable insights from PDF documents (foreign policy review) related to climate change. Using Python, the code analyzes the occurrence of the term "climate change," and generates word clouds to visually represent the context around these terms (using 7 words before and after the term, excluding prepositions, adverbs and other specific words).

## Key Features

- **Term Occurrence Analysis:** Counting occurrences of climate-related terms within PDF documents.
- **Contextual Word Extraction:** Identifying the seven words that precede and succeed each occurrence for deeper understanding.
- **Word Cloud Generation:** Visualizing the extracted information through captivating word clouds.
